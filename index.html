									<h2>BAJA SAE INDIA</h2>
									<p>The BAJA SAE Series® is an event for the undergraduate engineering students, organized globally by the Society of Automotive Engineers, USA. The event originated in the name of Mini - BAJA, in the year 1976 at University of Carolina. Since then, the event has spanned across six countries – USA, Mexico, South Africa, Korea, Brazil and India. The BAJA SAE tasks the students to design, fabricate and validate a single seater four - wheeled off road vehicle to take part in series of events spread over a course of 3 days that test the vehicle for the sound engineering practices that have gone into it, the agility of the vehicle in terms of gradability, speed, acceleration and manoeuvrability characteristics and finally its ability to endure that back breaking durability test. </p>

									<h3>BAJA SAE INDIA 2017</h3>
									<p>The BAJA SAE Series® is an event for the undergraduate engineering students, organized globally by the Society of Automotive Engineers,this was my first year to participate in BAJA SAE INDIA ,actually it was a start of my Engineering Career I get to learn many different techniques and skills from various experts,Solidworks Ansys Catia were the some of many software I get to learn during this preparation.</p>

									<h3>BAJA SAE INDIA 2018</h3>
									<p>This was my second event during this event I was the CAE Head of the team.I got opportunity to lead the CAE department,Improvement in this season in CAE Department was Dynamic Analysis of Rollcage and Multi body simulations of Suspension sub assemblies.This was a great opportunity to implement the knowledge I gained in previous season.</p>

									<h3>BAJA SAE INDIA 2019</h3>
									<p>In BAJA SAE INDIA 2019 I was the captain of the team Leading the team and improving team work gave me great experience in leadership and help to built my leadership qualities,In 2019 Virtual BAJA SAE INDIA our team was the 1st in technical quiz in all over India.Representing team and our college was a wonderful expirience and it helped me in building overall skillsets. </p>

									<h3>Topology Optimization of ATV Brake pedal(Reasearch Paper)</h3>
									<p>Weight reduction is required for increasing the overall efficiency of any design and machine so topological optimization gives us exact solution with almost same stiffness but less weight bt around 40 to 50%.</p>

									<h3>Customized Transmission system for ATV</h3>
									<p>For an ATV Torque and speed are both required so we have built a custom transmission two stage gearbox to use engine torque effectively as well as get enough speed.</p>

									<h3>Static and Dynamic analysis of Rollcage</h3>
									<p>While designing a offroad buggy driver safety is always priority to ensure the rollcage will sustain any kind of impact such as front impact side imact, rollover etc analysis of rollcage is importantwith static dynamic analysis is also very important to give us exact idea of non linear behaviour of material during impact and thus we can ensure the driver safety.</p>

									<h3>Multi Body Dynamics of a vehicle</h3>
									<p> Multi body dynamics tools are well established for simulation of structures and mechanisms characterized by Geometric linearity, large deflections, backlash, etc. These tools offer a variety of predefined components, linear as well as non-linear connections, etc. The equations of motion for these systems can only be solved in the time domain. Small time steps are required to correctly cover dynamical effects; selection of proper numerical solvers and time increments is mandatory to efficiently derive correct results. To keep computational efforts small, structural elements for  multi body models are usually represented by significantly simpler elements than detailed FE component models.</p>

									<h3>Unmanned arial vehicle with tranquilizing system for Wild animals</h3>
									<p>To save wild animals from humans while human animal conflits it is necessary to find a way to avoid human animal conficts as it is harmful for both humans and wild animals ,thus by using remote unmanned vehicle for tranquilizing we can avoid the human animal conflicts.</p>
